# Aliens

You've been asked to build an alien dating application! Work with  your partner in `Planet.rb` and `Alien.rb` in `lib/models` to complete the deliverables. To get started, `cd` into `02-ruby-alien-relationships` and open it with your IDE of choice. Be sure to `bundle install`. You can run the main file with the command `ruby bin/run.rb`.

### Deliverables:

- A planet has a `name`
- An alien has a `name`
- Aliens belong to a `planet` instance and know which planet they reside on
- A planet has an `#aliens` method that allows it to see all the aliens currently occupying it
- Alien instances have a `significant_other` attribute that refers to an alien they're dating, this can be `nil` if they're not currently dating anyone
- Alien instances have a `#go_on_date` method that takes in an argument of another alien and causes them to become significant others if they're both single
- Alien instances have a `#breakup` method that causes them and their `significant_other` to become single
- Alien instances have a `#ready_to_move` method that causes them to move to their `significant_other`s planet if they're not already there
- The Alien class has a `.singles` method that returns all the aliens that are currently single
- The Alien class has a `.dating` method that returns all the aliens that are currently in relationships
- A Planet instance has a `#local_singles` method that returns all the single aliens on that planet
- The Planet class has an `.empty_planets` method that returns every planet that doesn't have an alien on it

## Recommended workflow:

- Take turns being the driver. I'd recommend switching every fifteen or twenty minutes.
- If anyone has a question, look it up together. Researching is a skill, try and use google more often than your notes.
- If you find documentation that's hard to read, go through it together.
- If you get an error, try and explain what the error message is saying. What type of error is it? What method and line number is causing the error? What do you hypothesize is going wrong?
- One of the first rules of debugging is to check your assumptions. If something isn't working, test your variables to make sure they're coming through the way you think they are!
